NOTE: there may be a difference when parsing replays captured from a Wii vs a connection to a PC. Make sure that the PC captured replays are parsed the same as the Wii captured files. 

TODO: Rename replays against CPUs using the tag CPU for the character to make sure it is not a human player. 

TODO: generate file that lists the files that caused and error and the error that was caused. 

TODO: this is the file that will be reformatted and changed to accommodate threaded execution of the program.
