renameGames.py TODO List:
☐ rename CPU games by adding the CPU string to the characters name
☐ implement the generate_file_names() function that uses all the other generate_file_name() functions in it and returns the string to the rename_files_in_folder() function. 
☐ add CPU checking in doubles function.
☐ improve try and except blocks to be as specific as possible when an error occurs in program execution. 
☐ make sure that teams renaming works for non-2v2 teams situations. 
☐ reorganize so that the path.join() method is only called once in the program.
☐ look into why code will break when come files are processed. what is causing these issues?
☐ add command line arguments for specific directory renaming. 

☐ Game_20190914T141114.slp is ALWAYS causing an issue when trying to rename... figure out why and fix this. 
☐ NOTE: could all the leftover files after renaming be games that were ended early with an 'l r a start' ? Look into this issue... These files are corrupted after closer looks into them. They might have been caused when the connection between the Wii and the PC was severed improperly.
