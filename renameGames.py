TODO: generate file that lists the files that caused and error and the error that was caused. 

TODO: get the date-time for each file before the file is opened. reformat functions to only output the name of the file without the date-time attached. append the date-time after the filename has been generated. 

TODO: reformat the script so that the path.join() and the rename() functions are only called once. will make the program cleaner to read in the future.
